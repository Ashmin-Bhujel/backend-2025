  import mongoose from "mongoose";

  // Accessing environment variables
  config();
  const mongoDBUri = process.env.MONGODB_URI;
  const dbName = process.env.DB_NAME;
  const connectionString = `${mongoDBUri}/${dbName}`;

  async function connectDB() {
    try {
      const response = await mongoose.connect(connectionString);
      console.log("Successfully connected to MongoDB");
    } catch (error) {

      process.exit(1);
    }
  }

  export { connectDB };
  ```

## Configure Some Middlewares

The goal was to configure some essential middlewares for `Express` inside `app.js` file

```js
import { config } from "dotenv";
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";

// Accessing environment variables
config();
const corsOrigin = process.env.CORS_ORIGIN;
const app = express();

// Configurations
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: corsOrigin,
    credentials: true,
  })
);
app.use(express.json({ limit: "16kb" }));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "16kb" }));
app.use(express.static("public"));
app.use(cookieParser());

export { app };
```

### Middlewares

- `cors`: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

- `express.json()`: Middleware to parse incoming JSON requests and put the parsed data in `req.body`.

- `express.urlencoded()`: Middleware to parse incoming requests with urlencoded payloads and put the parsed data in `req.body`.

- `express.static()`: Middleware to serve static files from a directory.

- `cookie-parser`: Middleware to parse cookies attached to the client request object.

## `asyncHandler` Method and Some Custom Classes

The goal was to create an `asyncHandler` method and custom classes for `APIError` and `APIResponse`.

- [x] Create `utils/` directory inside the `src/` directory.

- [x] Create `asyncHandler.js` file inside `src/utils/` directory.

  ```js
  const asyncHandler = (handlerFunction) => (req, res, next) =>
    Promise.resolve(handlerFunction(req, res, next)).catch(next);
  ```

- [x] Create `apiError.js` file inside `src/utils/` directory.

  ```js
  class APIError extends Error {
    constructor(
      statusCode,
      message = "Something went wrong!",
      data = null,
      errors = []
    ) {
      super(message);
      this.name = this.constructor.name;
      this.statusCode = statusCode;
      this.data = data;
      this.errors = errors;
      this.success = false;
      Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }

    toJSON() {
      return {
        statusCode: this.statusCode,
        message: this.message,
        data: this.data,
        errors: this.errors,
        success: this.success,
      };
    }
  }
  ```

- [x] Create `apiResponse.js` file inside `src/utils/` directory.

  ```js
  class APIResponse {
    constructor(statusCode, message, data) {
      this.statusCode = statusCode;
      this.message = message;
      this.data = data;
      this.success = statusCode < 400;
    }
  }
  ```
